# Seems like you stambled upon my GitHub profile üëÄ

**Hi!** I'm @rollsicecream, a privacy advocate committed to advancing online security and personal privacy. I actively contribute to projects like [@techlore](https://github.com/techlore) and [@privacyguides](https://github.com/privacyguides), where I also volunteer as a translator to make vital privacy resources accessible in my language. I dedicate my time to supporting the projects I care about, that can be through direct contributions or by engaging with the communities at [Privacy Guides](https://discuss.privacyguides.net) and [Techlore](https://discuss.techlore.tech). You'll often find me online, ready to help or just chill in with people. üòä
